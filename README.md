# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

Twitter sentiment analysis project is a part of course on "Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms" by University of Washington on coursera. This project involves getting the twitter's tweet data using Twitter's application programming interface. This data was then used to derive sentiment of the tweets, determining sentiment of words in tweets, counting the top 10 hashtags, US states with maximum positive sentiment and counting frequency of terms in tweets.

More details on what to implement can be found in assignment.html file and the exact implementations can be found in the python files.
